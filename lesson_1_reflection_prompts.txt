How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

diff command helps us to see errors comparing if two files have the same lines, if don't, it shows up which lines are differents.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It lets to see how has been the process and the evolution, giving back feedbacks and showing how much have you learnt.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pros: you make a commit whenever you need it, cons: depends on me

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think it saves the files in a data base and it compares the files i choose.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

...

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Makes me work more confident because it is precise

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I wanna see it :)

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Thinking the same.
