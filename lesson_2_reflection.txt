what happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden files called .git which can store commits since the moment
it was created. You just need to type git init.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Working directory is where you have your files without tracking with git tool; 
staging area is where you put your files to make a commit; a repository is where
all commits are placed.
